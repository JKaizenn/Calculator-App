# Overview

As a software engineer continually seeking to broaden my skills and understanding, I've developed a Calculator application. This C++-based application serves as a practical tool to perform basic arithmetic operations and manage calculations through a user-friendly command-line interface. The project aims to reinforce my knowledge of C++'s core functionalities, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and user input validation. It has allowed me to experiment with and understand C++'s Standard Template Library (STL), exception handling, and file I/O operations.

# Development Environment

This application was developed using Visual Studio Code on macOS. C++ was the primary programming language used in this project, leveraging the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to manage and organize data effectively.

# Future Work

- **Implement More Complex Operations**: Add more advanced mathematical functions such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions.
- **Improve User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface using a library like Qt or SFML to enhance user interaction and accessibility.
- **Expand File I/O Functionality**: Add features to help save and load multiple calculation histories from different files, improving the application's flexibility and user control.
